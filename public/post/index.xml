      <description>I’ve recently made the jump from sp to sf for a lot of my simple spatial work. I’ll go into why in more detail below, but this was mostly because it plays so nicely with my tidy workflow. But I’ve also been wondering if I gain anything else from making the switch, or worse, if I’m losing out? My two main questions:
 Which is faster? Which one is better on my poor ol’ MacBook’s memory?</description>

      <description>I’ve recently been working on a monthly yellow fever dataset from Brazil that spans fourteen years. Overall, there are over 5600 spatial units and 168 months (that’s nearly 1,000,000 rows of data for those of you keeping track). It is great to have access to so much data, but sometimes visualizing it can be a bit of a pain, especially when we are trying to look at patterns across time and space.</description>
