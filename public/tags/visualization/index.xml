      <description>ggplot comes with a standard set of point shapes (below left) that you can use with geom_point that are generally enough for standard plotting. If you’re using ggplot for map making, you may require the use of symbols more common to GIS software (below right). This is where using your own custom images can be helpful.

There isn’t out-of-the-box support for using customs icons or images as points in ggplot (at least as far as I know), but you can add icons as a raster using annotation_raster.</description>

      <description>While boxplots may not be everyone’s favorite way to visualize a data distribution, they are a really useful data exploration tool, and being able to customize them to your every need is pretty great.

ggplot2 is great for easy out-of-the-box visualizations, and lets you do a lot of customizations once you get familiar with the grammar of it. But sometimes you want to trick out your plots with something even extra.</description>
