      <description>Iâ€™ve been getting more and more immersed into using tidyverse packages as time goes on. Every now and then I have trouble getting something to work that I could do very quickly in base R, but that seems to be happening less and less as more SO questions use the tidyverse and documentation gets better and better.
Anyways, I am a little late to the party but I recently discovered that you can pipe directly from your dplyr calls into ggplot2, manipulating and plotting your data all at once.</description>
