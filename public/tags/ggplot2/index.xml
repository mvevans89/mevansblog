      <description>I’ve been getting more and more immersed into using tidyverse packages as time goes on. Every now and then I have trouble getting something to work that I could do very quickly in base R, but that seems to be happening less and less as more SO questions use the tidyverse and documentation gets better and better.
Anyways, I am a little late to the party but I recently discovered that you can pipe directly from your dplyr calls into ggplot2, manipulating and plotting your data all at once.</description>

      <description>While boxplots may not be everyone’s favorite way to visualize a data distribution, they are a really useful data exploration tool, and being able to customize them to your every need is pretty great.

ggplot2 is great for easy out-of-the-box visualizations, and lets you do a lot of customizations once you get familiar with the grammar of it. But sometimes you want to trick out your plots with something even extra.</description>
