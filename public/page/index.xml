      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD student at the University of Georgia studying the ecology of mosquito-borne disease. I also like to play around with data, especially if it&amp;rsquo;s spatial. I started this blog as a way for myself to better my own coding practices, and share some things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned with others.
For more information about my research, head over to my personal website.
This blog was created using the blogdown package with the ghostwriter theme.</description>
