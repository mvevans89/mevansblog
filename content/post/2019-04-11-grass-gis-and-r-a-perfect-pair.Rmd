I'm always amazed at how many types of spatial analyses that are now possible in `R` and how fast the field is growing. But, you can't quite do everything purely in `R` yet, and sometimes need to call on some already existing open source software.

In this post I'm going to go over how to integrate [GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/) into your `R` workflow. If you've worked with [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) for a while, you may remember at one point installing GRASS as part of the steps to get QGIS up and running. QGIS continues to work really nicely with GRASS through plug-ins, but its no longer part of the installation.

GRASS, which stands for the Geographic Resources Analysis Support System, is an open source software that's part of the suite of tools available through the [Open Source Geospatial Foundation](https://www.osgeo.org/). It is available both as a command line tool and GUI and can handle raster and vector data. I use GRASS because it offers topology tools that I would otherwise need to use ArcGIS for, such as creating a stream network or calculation flow accumulation across a watershed. It is *not* really well set up for just visualizing data, and is better thought of as an analysis tool to become part of your workflow, rather than replace the whole thing.

Luckily, if you currently work in `R`, there is a package called `rgrass7` that makes it relatively easy to start using GRASS through R. As with all open source tools, the installation and set-up can be a little tricky. However, because you can use command line scripts, it becomes very easy to use once everything is set up.

# Installing GRASS on your machine

Before you can use GRASS thru R, you need to install GRASS on your machine. You can download the software [here](https://grass.osgeo.org/download/) and follow the [official installation guide](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Installation_Guide). I would recommend downloading the latest stable release.

I'm running Mac OS (Mojave) and hit some speed bumps when installing GRASS on my laptop. I've also installed it on Ubuntu and the process was a breeze, so it is dependent on OS.

My main issue was finding the path to the GRASS GIS library. Normally this can be done by opening a `Terminal` and using `which` or `type` to find a PATH, but this was not working. Robin Lovelace recommends using the `findGRASS()` function from the `link2GI` package in the GRASS section of her *Geocompution with R* [book](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/gis.html#rgrass). This was resulting in the following error:

```{r, eval = F}
Warning message:
In system2("find", paste(MP, " ! -readable -prune -o -type f -executable -iname 'grass??' -print"),  :
  running command ''find' /usr  ! -readable -prune -o -type f -executable -iname 'grass??' -print 2>/dev/null' had status 1
```

Luckily, GRASS is pretty transparent in how it runs. When you open the GUI version by clicking on it in your `Applications` folder, a `Terminal` will open that shows the PATH to the GRASS library.

From there, I just did some digging around to find which subdirectory held the `bin` and `lib` directories, with the final PATH: `/Applications/GRASS-7.6.app/Contents/Resources`. The actual path will likely differ depending on how you chose to install GRASS, but this method should work for finding the PATH in the end.
