<p><code>ggplot</code> comes with a standard set of point shapes (below left) that you can use with <code>geom_point</code> that are generally enough for standard plotting. If you’re using <code>ggplot</code> for map making, you may require the use of symbols more common to GIS software (below right). This is where using your own custom images can be helpful.</p>
<p>IMAGE COMPARING POINTS</p>
<p>There isn’t out-of-the-box support for using customs icons or images as points in <code>ggplot</code> (at least as far as I know), but you can add icons as a raster using <code>annotation_raster</code>. Here’s a quick example, with a function to do it all at the bottom.</p>
<p>TL;DR - skip to the function [link to code at bottom of page]</p>
<div id="civic-buildings-in-dc" class="section level1">
<h1>Civic buildings in DC</h1>
<p>I use this most often with spatial data for maps, so will demonstrate with an example of some public buildings in Washington, DC. DC has a great <a href="https://opendata.dc.gov/">open data dashboard</a>, so is a useful example for things like this.</p>
</div>
