I'm a PhD student at the University of Georgia studying the ecology of mosquito-borne disease. I also like to play around with data, especially if it's spatial. I started this blog as a way for myself to better my own coding practices, and share some things I've learned with others.

For more information about my research, head over to my [personal website](https://mvevans89.github.io/).

This blog was created using the [`blogdown` package](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) with the [ghostwriter](https://github.com/jbub/ghostwriter) theme. This `R` package uses the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to render RMarkdown files into html. The raw code for my site can be found in my [github repo](https://github.com/mvevans89/mevansblog).
