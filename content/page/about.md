## About

![](/img/bb8.png)

I'm a PhD student at the University of Georgia studying the ecology of mosquito-borne disease. I also like to play around with data, especially if it's spatial. I started this blog as a way for myself to better my own coding practices, and share some things I've learned with others.

For more information about my research, check out my [personal website](https://mvevans89.github.io/).
